          <h2>Blanchard History and Culture</h2>
          <p>
            Blanchard Springs Caverns (BSC) is a magnificent limestone cave
            system starting more than 200 feet underground in the Sylamore
            Ranger District of the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest, fifteen
            miles northwest of Mountain View (Stone County). The only cave
            administered by the U.S. Forest Service, it is considered one of the
            most beautiful in the country. Three guided tours through the caves
            are open to the public: the Dripstone Trail (open all year), the
            Discovery Trail (open during the summer), and the Wild Cave (open by
            special reservation).
          </p>

          <p>
            The limestone rock from which the cave developed was formed by
            fossilized sediment from sea creatures at the bottom of an ancient
            inland sea estimated to exist about 350 to 500 million years ago.
            When prehistoric land masses shifted, the seabed was uplifted about
            300 million years ago to form the Ozark Plateau. The exposed land
            was shaped by the elements, such as wind and rain, into mountains
            and rivers. When the slightly acidic rainfall penetrated cracks and
            crevices in the limestone, cavities were formed. Water entered,
            enlarging the cavities as it flowed through and filled them. As the
            water cut its way downward, seeking lower levels, it left hollow,
            air-filled caves. Dripping water from above then deposited calcium
            carbonate and other minerals to form the cave features and
            formations, called speleothems, which continue to change as long as
            water continues to drip.
          </p>

          <p>
            The spring (defined as a natural source of running water) that
            formed the cavern emerges from the mountainside in a waterfall and
            flows into a trout pond called Mirror Lake. The spring was named for
            John H. Blanchard, who left his family’s plantation in Kentucky and
            fought for the Confederacy, enlisting in the Kentucky Volunteers in
            1861. Following bitter conflict at such battles as Chickamauga,
            where he was wounded, Blanchard sought peace after the war ended by
            homesteading 160 acres in the tranquil Ozarks. There, he built a
            gristmill powered by the falling spring which now bears his name.
            Blanchard was also elected to two terms as Stone County treasurer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though there is graffiti in the cave saying “John 1922,” it was not
            John Blanchard, as he died in 1914 at age seventy-four. Local
            residents were aware of the cave in the 1930s but the only entrances
            were a sheer seventy-five-foot drop and underwater through the
            spring as it exited, so exploration was delayed until more modern
            technology and equipment could be developed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first documented visit was in 1934, by Civilian Conservation
            Corps (CCC) planner Willard Hadley. Amateur spelunkers in 1955 found
            a human cranium, footprints, and other signs of exploration by
            Native Americans; cane and wooden torch remains underwent
            radiocarbon dating and indicated that prehistoric human exploration
            of the cave occurred at least during AD 215–1155. The first
            professional exploration was in 1960 by Hugh Shell and Hail Bryant.
            In 1971, scuba divers entered through the spring entrance and
            followed its course. The divers followed 4,000 feet of underwater
            passages and also mapped five caverns filled with air but
            inaccessible at that time. They photographed the awesome cave
            formations and noted forms of cave life. They estimated that it
            takes about twenty-four hours for water to flow through the cave, a
            journey of less than a mile.
          </p>

          <p>
            BSC is referred to as a “living” or “active” cave, as it is
            constantly being changed. Guides point out that no two tours are the
            same. The caverns include an underground river, delicate “soda
            straw” formations, stalactites (pointing downward from the ceiling),
            stalagmites (rising from the floor), columns (where stalactites and
            stalagmites meet), and huge areas of flowstone, or sheet-like
            calcite deposits formed where water flows down a wall or along the
            floor.
          </p>

          <p>
            The cave temperature remains at fifty-eight degrees Fahrenheit,
            making it a popular summertime attraction. The relative humidity
            hovers around 100 percent, with the trails generally remaining wet.
            The caverns have been kept as close to natural conditions as
            possible, though features such as lights, handrails, and paved
            walkways were added for safety. Guests are advised to bring a jacket
            and low-heeled, non-slip shoes. From April through October, the
            caverns are open seven days a week. The rest of the year, they are
            closed Monday and Tuesday, as well as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and
            New Year’s Day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Blanchard Springs Caverns opened to the public in 1973 with the
            Dripstone Trail Tour after ten years of planning and development.
            The Dripstone Tour starts by riding an elevator 216 feet below
            ground and lasts around one hour. Running about a half-mile one way
            through the most highly decorated area of the caverns, it includes
            two “rooms” filled with stalactites, soda straws, and a natural
            bridge, as well as the Cathedral Room, which is more than 1,000 feet
            long and includes a stone column more than six stories tall. During
            the Christmas season, the annual Caroling in the Caverns event with
            vocal and instrumental music takes place in the acoustically superb
            Cathedral Room; performances sell out each year. The Dripstone Trail
            tour is recommended for most visitors, especially beginners.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Discovery Trail tour was opened to the public in 1977. It takes
            up to two hours, covering just over a mile. There are 686 stair
            steps in this tour, which is usually recommended for those who do
            not have health problems or difficulty walking. It descends to the
            lower level of the cave, 366 feet underground, as well as to the
            Natural Entrance, about seventy feet below ground at that point,
            following the streambed of the springs that created the cavern. This
            tour includes the Rimstone Dams, which create pools along the
            streambed, and the ethereal Ghost Room with its shimmering white
            flowstone.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Wild Cave tour is by reservation only for groups of three to
            twelve. It provides advanced participants with several hours of
            climbing, crawling, scaling boulders, wedging under low ceilings,
            and usually getting dirty as they explore undeveloped parts of the
            cave. Participants must wear sturdy shoes or hiking boots and are
            provided with lights, helmets, strong gloves, and kneepads.
            Participants must be at least ten years old; ten to twelve year olds
            must tour with a responsible adult.
          </p>

          <p>
            Great care is taken to preserve BSC’s environmental system so that
            it might be enjoyed in its natural state for generations to come.
            The Visitor Information Center has a free twenty-minute-movie, The
            Amazing World Below, and the exhibit hall. Musician Jimmy Driftwood,
            a Mountain View native, was instrumental in environmental issues and
            the preservation of Ozark mountain culture. His music is the
            backdrop of the introductory film on the caverns.
          </p>

          <p>
            The exhibit hall highlights the plants and animals who call the
            caverns their home. Shade-loving mosses and ferns can be found near
            the cave entrance. Farther back in the caverns, only bacteria, mold,
            and fungi are able to grow. Salamanders, frogs, and crickets are
            commonly found at BSC. The Discovery Trail attracts the endangered
            gray bat and is closed when bats are hibernating. Each winter, up to
            150,000 bats hibernate undisturbed in this secluded portion of BSC.
            In the summer, they disperse to other nesting places in and around
            Arkansas, eating tons of insects, such as mosquitoes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some animals spend their entire lives in the darkness of the caves,
            including the Ozark blind salamander, (the first cave-dwelling
            amphibian found in America), which is native to Blanchard Springs
            Caverns. BSC even has its own food chain, with bat droppings (called
            guano), bacteria, mold, and fungi as sources of food for snails and
            insects which are in turn eaten by crickets, salamanders, and
            spiders.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are nearby campgrounds and seasonal programs with the caverns
            as centerpiece. Blanchard Springs Caverns was almost recruited by
            the federal government as a fallout shelter during the Cold War,
            though the plan was abandoned due to air circulation from the
            outside spanning only twenty-four hours. Thus, BSC does not sport
            the familiar black-and-yellow Civil Defense sign as some other caves
            do. Visitors are usually too dazzled by its awesome beauty to
            notice.

              Forty eight years have passed since cavers exploring the lower
              sections of Blanchard Springs Caverns made their way up a steep
              rocky wall and squeezed their way through a narrow opening. What
              they encountered was amazing, though dim lights made visible only
              a small sliver of their colossal discovery. They had entered
              what's now known as the upper, or Dripstone, level of the caverns,
              where the largest rooms and most spectacular formations are found!

              Although not open at this time, Wonderland Cave in Bella Vista,
              Arkansas was a sight to behold in it's day! The Wonderland Cave
              opened to the public on February, 28, 1930. The likes of Cab
              Calloway and Duke Ellington performed at the cave for almost
              thirty years. Political and social events were also held in what
              was known as "The Big Cave". Clarence Linebarger had seen clubs
              built in caves on a trip to Paris in 1929.<a

              In 2007, approximately 8,000 to 11,000 bats died in several New
              York caves, more than half of the wintering bat population in
              those caves. Cavers first noticed large numbers of dead bats
              around the mouth of one cave and reported it to wildlife officials
              in February 2006. Many of the dead bats had a white ring of fungus
              around their nose. Most affected hibernating bats in the region
              have white fungal growth on their ears, wings or nose. This
              condition is called White-nose Syndrome (WNS) and is associated
              with high bat mortality in the northeastern United States.<a

              The Rock: Blanchard Springs Caverns is located in sedimentary rock
              that was laid down during the Upper Ordovician - Lower
              Mississippian periods (310-460 million years ago). At that time
              northern Arkansas was covered by a shallow sea that teemed with
              life. During most of the period limey sediments built up from the
              shells of the sea animals that died. As the layers of shells got
              deeper and deeper, they were compressed to form limestone rock.<a
